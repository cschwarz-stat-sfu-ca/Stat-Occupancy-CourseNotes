Grand Skinks
   Single Species Multi Season^M

   Ships with PRESENCE.

   Data has been collected on 352 tors over a 5 year (the seasons) period,^
   although not all tors (rock piles) were surveyed each year, with up to 3 surveys^
   of each tor per year.  

   The 15 columns are in 5 blocks of 3.

   There is also a site-specific covariate Pasture indicating whether the surrounding^
   matrix is either predominately the modified habitat (farm pasture, Pasture =1) or
   "native" grassland (tussock, Pasture = 0).
