An occupancy study was made on Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea) on 41 old fields planted 
to longleaf pines (Pinus palustris) in southern Georgia, USA. 



Surveys were 500 m transects across each field and were completed three 
times during the breeding season in 2001.  

The data are located in a comma-delimited 
text file. 



The first column (which is optional) is a label for each site, simple numbered 1 - 41.  
The next 3 columns are the detection histories for each site on each of 3 occasions during the 2001 breeding season.    


Other covariates are:
   
field.size - size of the files

   bqi Enrollment in bobwihte quail initiative; does occupancy increase if field belongs to this initiative?
   
crop.hist
   
crop1
crop2	
 
   count1, count2, count3 are actual counts of animals detected in each detection period, and are not used in the basic occupancy analysis.
