Two species of trout Co-occurrence
   Multi season single season

   Sample dataset from Parks Canada. Random noise added to values of variables
   to preserve anonymity.

   BKTR and BLTR measured in watersheds in Alberta
   Bull trout are native and require cold water; brook trout are from the east
   and are supposed to have warmer temperature preferences.

   Each site was sampled twice, represented as "rep1" and "rep2"
   in the database. 

   I have more than a lot of predictors, but the two
   predictors of occupancy that I would be most interested in are temperature
   and discharge
