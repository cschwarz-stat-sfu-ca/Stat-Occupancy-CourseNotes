These are the daily binary detection data from camera trap surveys of Lower Keys marsh rabbits
 and free-ranging domestic cats from 84 sites on the public lands of Big Pine Key, Florida 
(Cove et al., 2018). 

Additional habitat and predator covariates are also included associated with each of the camera trap sites.

The UTM coordinates are listed for each site, as well as start and end dates for surveys from 2015. 
Specific start and end dates from 2013/14 can be requested from the lead author 
(M. Cove). 

Detections are reported for the 2013 or 2014 season (dependent on when the site was first surveyed) 
and the final (2015) season for both marsh rabbits and co-occurring cats. 

Covariate abbreviations are as follows: 
year_2013 = binary index to distinguish 2013 primary survey from 2014 primary survey; 

dist_cam_z = standardized distance between the paired camera traps; 
Total CatCaps_2013_14 = the total number of cat detections at the site in the first primary survey; 
CatIndividuals_2013_14 = the total number of individual cats (identified based on pelage) 
    detected at the site in the first primary survey; 
Total CatCaps_2015 is the total number of cat detections at the site in the final primary survey (2015); 
CatIndividuals_2015 is the total number of individual cats (identified based on pelage) 
    detected at the site in the final primary survey (2015); 
RabbitPresence_2013_14 is the binary observed presence of rabbits in the first primary survey; 

HumanTrail is a binary covariate equivalent to 1 if site is located on a trail or 0 if not; 

dist_rd_z is the standardized distance between the camera trap site and the nearest road; 

dist_dev_z is the standardized distance between the camera trap site and the nearest human development; 

dist_cat2014_z is the standardized distance between the camera trap site and the nearest cat trapped and removed in 2014; 
dist_cat2015_z is the standardized distance between the camera trap site and the nearest cat trapped and removed in 2015; 
bin_2014cat is a binary covariate related to cats trapped within a 500m buffer surrounding the camera trap site in 2014; 
bin_2015cat is a binary covariate related to cats trapped within a 500m buffer surrounding the camera trap site in 2015; 

bin_20142015 is a binary covariate related to cats trapped within a 500m buffer surrounding the camera trap site in 2014 and/or 2015; 

Description is the habitat type, followed by dummy categorical covariates for those habitat types; 

hectares_z is the standardized patch size of the habitat patch that contains the camera trap site; and 

LiDar_z is the standardized elevation surrounding a 25m buffer around the camera trap sites 
  based off of LiDar data.
