   Single season single species occupancy<br>
   <p>An occupancy study was made on Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea) on 41 old fields 
     planted to longleaf pines (Pinus palustris) in southern Georgia, USA.
    Surveys were 500 m transects across each field and were completed
    three times during the breeding season in 2001.
    Columns in the file are:
    <ul>
    <li>field - field number
    <li>v1, v2, v3 - detection histories for each site on each of 3 visit during the 2001 breeding season.
    <li>field.size - size of the fields
    <li>bqi - Enrollment in bobwihte quail initiative; does occupancy increase if field belongs to this initiative?
    <li>crop.hist - crop history
    <li>crop1, crop2 - indicator variables for the crop history
    <li> count1, count2, count3 - actual counts of birds detected in each visit
